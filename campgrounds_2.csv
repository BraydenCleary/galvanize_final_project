The trail passes just to the north of the famous Bonneville Salt Flats and crosses a large mud playa known as Pilot Valley before finally arriving at Donner Spring. This emigrant route across the eastern Great Basin, first pioneered by John C. Fremont’s 1845 expedition, was made infamous in its promotion by Lansford Hastings and subsequent use by the Donner-Reed Party in 1846.For parties that chose to attempt the Hastings Cutoff, the crossing of Pilot Valley and arrival at Donner Spring was the final desperate leg of a nearly 90-mile waterless passage across the Great Salt Lake Desert that caught most emigrants unaware and ill-prepared. Because of its central location on the trail, this 2-3 day passage usually had to be endured by man and beast in August, over mud and sand, in near triple digit temperatures. During its historical use from 1846-1850, numerous first-person journal accounts document harrowing ordeals involving extreme dehydration, dead and dying livestock, abandoned wagons, stranded or delirious emigrants, and heroic rescues. The Donner Reed Party’s loss of oxen in Pilot Valley likely contributed to their later winter entrapment and forced cannibalism in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Today, trail enthusiasts can drive maintained dirt roads an hour north of Wendover, Utah along the scenic Silver Island Mountains Backcountry Byway and view the Hastings Cutoff route in a setting largely unchanged from when emigrants struggled through this dramatic and hauntingly vast landscape. If one knows where to look, trail traces are still detectable across the mud playa and mountain benches. The Oregon-California Trail Association (OCTA) and BLM have placed route markers and signs at Donner-Reed Pass. The NPS and OCTA maintain an excellent interpretive site at Donner Spring near the base of Pilot Peak. Stories and actual artifacts from the trail can be viewed today by appointment at the Donner Reed Museum in Grantsville, Utah. Several outstanding sources on the Hastings Cutoff across Utah are readily available, including important works by Charles Kelly and Dale Morgan.

You’ll find this BLM-managed gem less than two hours away from Logan, and if you’re coming this way, chances are you’ll want to partake in some outdoor recreation. The nearby 25-acre reservoir draws in boaters and anglers, and the scene stays calm thanks to speed restrictions and the fact that you’ll have to carry your watercraft in by hand. It’s also a great area for winter fun, like cross country skiing and snowmobiling. And, speaking of motorized fun, you’ll be right by the Shoshone OHV Trail.

Beginning with its earliest known inhabitants, the Coastal Miwoks, Angel Island was a seasonal hunting and gathering location for the local native tribes before it became a safe refuge and supply stop for Spanish explorers like Juan Manuel de Ayala, one of the first to map the San Francisco Bay. The Island has also been a cattle ranch, immigration station, and military base. From 1910 to 1940, the U.S. Immigration Station processed hundreds of thousands of immigrants, the majority from China. During World War II, Japanese, and German POWs were detained on the island before being sent to facilities farther inland. Angel Island has over 150 years of military history. During the Civil War in 1863, the federal government established Camp Reynolds on the island to protect the Bay Area from rising threats of confederate sympathizers. With the outbreaks of WWI and WWII, thousands of troops both returning and embarking for conflicts around the world were processed through Angel Island. In the 1950’s and 1960’s, the Island saw its last military service as a home to a Nike missile base. In 1954 the transition of Angel Island as a California State Park began. Starting with Ayala Cove on the western side of the Island, park visitors had the first opportunities to enjoy the beauty of this amazing Island. In the early 1960's the final departure of the military allowed the rest of Angel Island to become park lands and the rest is history! | True |  | True | One of the best urban playgrounds out there, Angel Island State Park is hidden gem just a quick jaunt from San Francisco. Hop on a ferry from Pier 41 or Tiburon for camping, miles of hiking trails, and some of the best views in the Bay Area. Angel Island is a spectacular grass and woodland covered island—in fact, it’s the largest island in the San Francisco Bay. It offers a plethora of expansive views of the San Francisco skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the surrounding Bay Area. Imagine unzipping your tent to views of sparkling city lights and golden sunrise hues. The island features great hiking and biking trails as well as many other interesting recreational opportunities, including Segway tours. Angel Island State Park truly is a Bay Area experience not to be missed. Choose from 16 campsites divided into four distinct camping areas (East Bay, Ridge, Sunrise, and Kayak Camp), each with pit toilets and water nearby. From the Ridge sites, enjoy picturesque views of San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, but expect a bit of wind. Sites in the East Bay section are more protected. If you’re traveling with a larger group, the Sunrise sites may be a good fit, as the sites can be reserved individually or combined for groups up to 24 people. Kayak Camp is also group friendly, accommodating groups up to 20. Angel Island camping typically doesn’t offer much in the way of privacy, but with only 16 sites on the island, it’s likely that you won’t be battling crowds. Be sure to pack carefully for Angel Island camping trips—the walk to your campsite can be up to two miles!  | True | None | 227 | True | True | Tent Only | None |  | 39 | None | Angel Island State Park | True | None | Reserve Online | 1 |  | /california/angel-island/angel-island-campground |  | 1 | True |  |  | 2017-08-01T23:23:14.490-07:00 | True | 06041 | America/Los_Angeles | 1 | False | POINT (-122.431 37.8642) | None | 0.96 | 6 |  | True | False |  | 96.1538461538 | 0.0 | 37.8642 |  | None | 39 | True | reserve_america | (415) 435-5390 | Find serenity and adventure just a quick jaunt from San Francisco with a night of camping at Angel Island State Park.

You aren’t alone, that’s for sure! Basically, the Bureau of Land Management keeps tabs on public lands through their on-site Field Offices. Boom, easy explanation. Now, on to the good stuff. In Utah, the St. George Field Office manages around 629,000 acres of land in Washington County. The environment out here is pretty dang unique, because it’s situated at the convergence of the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau. Some plants and animals can only be found here in this unique area. Because it’s such a one-of-a-kind spot, the recreation opportunities are just as awesome. The BLM’s website describes them as “as diverse and challenging as the desert landscape.” We’ll raise a glass (or a tin camp mug) to that description! Easy sightseeing is an option, and hiking is another favorite activity for all levels. Mountain biking, rock climbing, and even canyoneering are all excellent ways to spend your time around St. George, too. | True | None | 4 | True | True | Tent Only, Tent, Vehicles & RVs | None |  |  | None | St. George Field Office | True | 6.0 | First Come First Serve | 5336 |  | /utah/st-george/baker-dam-campground |  | 52 | True |  |  | 2017-02-23T11:33:30.676-08:00 | True | 49053 | America/Denver | 1471 | False | POINT (-113.5767068 37.0828149) | None |  | 6 |  | True | False |  | 100.0 | 0.0 | 37.0828149 |  | None | 1 | True | walkup | 435-688-3200 | Mountains in the distance and crystal clear water right at your feet…you could say the scenery is quite fantastic at Baker Dam’s Campground.

It was (and is) a place of the deepest reverence. The first recorded ascent of Mount Tamalpais was made by a trader named Jacob Leese in the 1830’s. His native Miwoks friends refused to accompany him because they believed nobody would survive a visit to the sacred summit. After Leese returned alive, Chief Marin, after whom the county is named, also climbed to the top and enhanced his reputation among his people as the bravest man in the world. With the Gold Rush of 1849, San Francisco exploded and more people began to visit Mount Tamalpais for recreation. Trails were developed and a wagon road was built. Eventually a railway was completed and became known as "The Crookedest Railroad in the World." It was abandoned in 1930 after a wildfire damaged the line. You can learn more about the railroad at the East Peak Summit Visitor Center which features the Gravity Car Barn, a small museum of railroad history (open on weekends only). The peak and its surrounding areas are known as the birthplace of mountain biking in the 1970’s, where early mountain bikers including Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, and Joe Breeze pioneered the sport. | True |  | True | With amazing views of the Marin County hills, San Francisco Bay, the East Bay, and Mount Diablo, why wouldn’t you want to go Mt Tamalpais camping ASAP? Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, amongst the redwood groves and oak woodlands, Mount Tamalpais State Park is in the heart of Marin County. Spring and summer temperatures are perfect for camping with highs in the 70s and 80s. The diverse environment features a wide array of plant and animal species. Hikers enjoy more than 60 miles of park trails, connecting to a 200-mile trail system.

Let us introduce you to the elusive Steep Ravine Cabins and Campground. On Mt. Tamalpais, just to the north of the city, there are a group of wooden structures that date back to the 1940s. They are insanely popular and rightfully so. Each cabin features a wood stove, picnic table and several benches, sleeping platforms, and of course, an outdoor barbeque. The cabins do not have running water or electricity, but primitive toilets, water faucets, and firewood are nearby. The best attribute is that they all feature expansive ocean views, as they are perched high up on the side of a cliff. Steep Ravine Environmental Campground (tent sites) is also a great choice (if not one of the best in the area!) for Mount Tamalpais camping. If you like tent camping, then this is your spot. It’s also hugely popular and fills up fast, as there are only seven campsites. It is on the western edge of the park, and just to make matters more awesome, they are all overlooking the ocean. There’s lots of privacy and tons to do right around camp. The campsites are a few hundred yards from the parking area. Each site has a table, fire pit, food locker, and space for a tent. Primitive toilets and water faucets are nearby. There’s no showers, but don’t worry...it’s totally worth it. | 2013-12-20T18:48:30.969-08:00 |  | None | None

You aren’t alone, that’s for sure! Basically, the Bureau of Land Management keeps tabs on public lands through their on-site Field Offices. Boom, easy explanation. Now, on to the good stuff. In Utah, the St. George Field Office manages around 629,000 acres of land in Washington County. The environment out here is pretty dang unique, because it’s situated at the convergence of the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau. Some plants and animals can only be found here in this unique area. Because it’s such a one-of-a-kind spot, the recreation opportunities are just as awesome. The BLM’s website describes them as “as diverse and challenging as the desert landscape.” We’ll raise a glass (or a tin camp mug) to that description! Easy sightseeing is an option, and hiking is another favorite activity for all levels. Mountain biking, rock climbing, and even canyoneering are all excellent ways to spend your time around St. George, too. | True | None | 5 | True | True | Tent Only | None |  |  | None | St. George Field Office | True | 15.0 | First Come First Serve | 5337 |  | /utah/st-george/red-cliffs-campground |  | 52 | True |  |  | 2017-02-23T11:33:30.676-08:00 | True | 49053 | America/Denver | 1471 | False | POINT (-113.5767068 37.0828149) | None |  | 6 |  | True | False |  | 100.0 | 0.0 | 37.0828149 |  | None | 2 | True | walkup | 435-688-3200 | Red, red cliffs...stay close to me… Okay, so it might not have the same melodic charm as the original song, but this area is going to remain close to your heart long after you head back home.

You’ll have trails right next to camp, including interpreted archaeological and paleontological sites. You can even escape the crazy desert heat here, because the campground is snuggled up into a shaded spot with lots of vegetation. But, before you make the trip out, be sure that your vehicle is less than 12 feet in height and width.

Nearly 500 people, originally from Canton, China, lived in the village. In its heyday, there were three general stores, a marine supply store and a barber shop. Fishermen by trade in their native country, they gravitated to the work they knew best. Over 90% of the shrimp they netted were dried and shipped to China or Chinese communities throughout the US. The museum at China Camp Village helps tell the story of these hardy shrimp fishermen.

He actually found gold, cashed in, and entered the lumber business. Purchasing 101 acres of timberland along Papermill Creek (then called Daniel's Creek), Taylor built a paper mill and established a paper-making process. Using scrap paper and rags from San Francisco, the mill produced newsprint and the world’s first square-bottomed paper bags -- a novelty at the time. Taylor, with help from the Northern Pacific Coast Railroad, built a resort hotel and Camp Taylor, one of the first sites in the US to offer camping as a recreational pursuit. The area was one of California's most popular and well-known weekend recreation destinations in the 1870s-1880s. | True |  | True | Majestic redwoods, rolling hills, oak studded grasslands and flowing creeks combine in a gorgeous display of natural beauty at Samuel P. Taylor State Park. This Marin County staple contains over 2,700 acres of redwood and grassland, including 600 acres of old-growth forest. The park offers a vast network of hiking trails, which make it relatively easy to hop to the top of Mount Barnabe.

Just about every California Indian community who viewed Mount Diablo would, at one time or another, make a pilgrimage to the summit area for ceremonies. The reason Mount Diablo is so sacred to the California Indian people is that it was the creation point for the Miwok people or genesis for some California Indian people. In 1851, the mountaintop was selected as the starting point for a survey of the public domain. Ignoring the excitement of the Gold Rush, Leander Ransom and his men erected a flagpole at the summit of Mount Diablo and began to extend the base and meridian lines that we use to this day in our official land surveys. As a matter of fact, Mount Diablo base and meridian lines are referred to in legal descriptions of real estate throughout two-thirds of California and parts of Nevada and Oregon. Toll roads up the mountain were opened in 1874, and for many years there were two stagecoaches every day connecting Walnut Creek and Danville with Mountain House, a 16-room hotel about three miles from the summit. The Stage Road, near Pine Canyon, was one of the original stagecoach line routes. The hotel offered all conveniences and was known for its excellent food. Wedding ceremonies were a frequent occurrence at the hotel, and celebrities from all over Europe and America were among the visitors. In those days, it was widely held that you hadn’t seen the West if you hadn’t watched a sunset, sunrise, or full moon from the upper slopes of the mountain. Business at the hotel declined after the summit observation platform burned in 1891, and shortly thereafter the hotel burned down as well. The toll roads were reopened in 1915,so that the view from the summit was once again available to all. In 1921, a parcel of land on the mountain was designated a state park, and much of the rest of the mountain was declared a game refuge. Standard Oil placed a ten-million-candlepower aerial navigation beacon on the summit in 1928. The beacon was so powerful that it could be seen by ships 100 miles at sea. Finally, in 1931, the state acquired more land for Mount Diablo State Park, and the park was formally dedicated and opened to the public. | True |  | True | Find some of the most expansive views in California at Mount Diablo State Park, where vistas from the top of Mount Diablo on a clear day span 35 of California’s 58 counties. Bring a pair of binoculars and you might even be able to catch sight of Yosemite’s iconic Half Dome. Mount Diablo stands 3,864 feet high and is considered to be an ecological gem of the Bay Area, with a recognisable peak that’s visible from most of northern California. Beyond the views, Mt. Diablo State Park's massive 20,000-acres offers plentiful opportunities for climbing, hiking, biking, camping, and horseback riding amidst colorful wildflowers and interesting rock formations.

Easily accessible and located inside the South Gate at the base of the mountain, Live Oak Campground is a great spot if you are planning on exploring the entire mountain or only have one night. Take your pick among 22 sites, but be aware that the sites are close together so privacy can be an issue. Campsites 10 through 16 offer the most seclusion. Closest to the top of the mountain, the sites at Juniper boast incredible views well worth the climb. Camping here is fairly comfortable with access to fire rings, picnic tables, toilets, and some showers. All of Mount Diablo tends to be on the dry side, so be sure to bring lots of water. | 2013-12-20T18:48:30.974-08:00 |  | None | None

In 1769 the Portola Expedition “discovered” the redwoods in the south Santa Cruz Area and camped at the beginning of Waddell Creek. They were all mostly ill with scurvy, however the bountiful land produced berries which they attributed to their quick recovery. Thus they gave the valley the name, “Canada de la Salud” or Canyon of Health. During the Spanish occupation of the area, Big Basin continued to serve as a refuge for the Ohlone Indians. They had an active resistance to the Spanish power which was led by Charquin, a leader of the Quiroste people in the area. By the late 19th century, the redwood forests were gaining a type of international appreciation. A group of well known conservationists led the movement to create a recognized park and preserve the majestic forests. In 1902 the “California Redwood Park” was established on the 3,800 acres that is Big Basin. In the following years, visitation grew steadily as park amenities were built. During the Great Depression era, the Civilian Conservation Corps whom were assigned to the area, built the amphitheater, trails and many buildings. The infrastructure, built then, still serves us today! | True |  | True | In the heart of the Santa Cruz mountains you can find California’s oldest state park. It is home to the largest continuous stand of ancient Coastal Redwoods. Some of the giant trees are more than 50 feet around and as tall as the Statue of Liberty. In addition to the beautiful, historic trees (some which predate the Roman Empire), the park offers insane views of the Pacific Ocean (hikers adore the 10.5 mile Skyline to Sea Trail!). Berry Creek falls is just one of the many waterfalls to explore. Elevation in the park varies from sea level to above 2,000 feet and the natural features are diverse, ranging from wet forest to arid and desert-like. With over 18,000 acres of area to hike, bike and play in, there is no opportunity for boredom at Big Basin.

The infrastructure, built then, still serves us today! | True |  | True | In the heart of the Santa Cruz mountains you can find California’s oldest state park. It is home to the largest continuous stand of ancient Coastal Redwoods. Some of the giant trees are more than 50 feet around and as tall as the Statue of Liberty. In addition to the beautiful, historic trees (some which predate the Roman Empire), the park offers insane views of the Pacific Ocean (hikers adore the 10.5 mile Skyline to Sea Trail!). Berry Creek falls is just one of the many waterfalls to explore. Elevation in the park varies from sea level to above 2,000 feet and the natural features are diverse, ranging from wet forest to arid and desert-like. With over 18,000 acres of area to hike, bike and play in, there is no opportunity for boredom at Big Basin. Big Basin offers 146 campsites, four group sites, tent cabins, backcountry hike-in trail camps, and horse camping. So what’re you waiting for?

Two large camps hold 40 people each, and can be booked together or individually. Along with plenty of Coastal Redwoods, Sky Meadow is a great launching pad for all your forest adventures, with the Sempervirens River and falls nearby, and access to Big Basin Redwoods State Park’s extensive trail system. Sky Meadow provides flat, spacious sites tucked right into the redwoods and is big enough to give everyone in your party some time alone with these ancient trees. This site provides water and pit toilets, but there are no showers or hot water, so you’ll have to head to the river for that! | 2013-12-20T18:48:30.918-08:00 |  | None | None

The cabin sites only a few feet from Cedar Creek. It is a nice clean cool mountain creek, that is invigorating, mostly shallow creek with a few smaller deeper holes that trout might be hiding in.The bungalow sits on the edge of the farm well away from the main part of activities. There is a small raise platform for a bed (with only camper pads for a mattress at the moment. It is approximately 10x16 and has wood sides up to about 3' and then it is all screen. There is also a jungle mosquito canopy screen over the bed that is quite roomy and allows you a bug free sleep! You can have a small campfire outside. Inside there is no electricity or anything like that. It is very rustic yet delightful. Currently there is no camp stove there. You can bring one and set up a camp if you like but please clean up after yourself to keep the critters at bay. Otherwise people come up to the main part of the farm to use the facilities there. Again, it is rustic, There are only outside kitchens. The farm is surrounded on three sides by mountains, with Cedar creek along one edge. The herbs are grown in the middle of a 10-acre field. There are numerous outbuildings for the operations of the farm. Sometimes I get to mowing/weed whacking, sometimes the weeds and grass grows up-( I will be happy to keep the weeds down around the cabin when you let me know when you will be here, but just know it is a organic/biodynamic farm that does value the biodiversity that an overgrown field offers) You are also welcome to take part in farm activities about any day. There is always weeding to be done! Also planting, harvesting, seed saving, drying and processing herbs etc. You can also harvest some for yourself for tea or medicine.The area is well known for offering all the outdoor recreation one could want within a few minutes to a few hours.I hope you enjoy the outdoors soon! | 2017-08-16T05:44:07.227-07:00 | True | None | None

In 1769 the Portola Expedition “discovered” the redwoods in the south Santa Cruz Area and camped at the beginning of Waddell Creek. They were all mostly ill with scurvy, however the bountiful land produced berries which they attributed to their quick recovery. Thus they gave the valley the name, “Canada de la Salud” or Canyon of Health. During the Spanish occupation of the area, Big Basin continued to serve as a refuge for the Ohlone Indians. They had an active resistance to the Spanish power which was led by Charquin, a leader of the Quiroste people in the area. By the late 19th century, the redwood forests were gaining a type of international appreciation. A group of well known conservationists led the movement to create a recognized park and preserve the majestic forests. In 1902 the “California Redwood Park” was established on the 3,800 acres that is Big Basin. In the following years, visitation grew steadily as park amenities were built.

The lands provided everything for them, including obsidian for arrows, and a large variety of goods from the coastal area. The Wappo village, called Wilikos, resisted Spanish settlers for some time. However, before long, the people were forcibly moved from their lands to reservations. There were many efforts to retain their culture, identity and language, but eventually they were lost. Today some Wappo descendants are making an effort to revive their spoken language. By the 1870s, a number of settlers were living in the hills near Sugarloaf Ridge. Farming was limited and marginal. One settler cut and slowly burned trees to make charcoal that was sold in San Francisco. Eventually “gentlemen farmers” came to own Sugarloaf Ridge; hired managers ran their ranches while they tended to other businesses in town. The State of California bought the property in 1920 to dam the creek and provide water for Sonoma State Hospital, but neighbors along the creek objected. Until World War II, the area was used for camping, picnicking and a Boy Scout camp. In 1942 the land was leased for grazing, and it became part of the California State Park System in 1964. | True |  | True | Sugarloaf straddles the border of Napa and Sonoma Counties and features over 25 miles of trails. It offers a 25-foot waterfall that can be seen in all its glory after a winter rain storm. The park contains the headwaters of Sonoma Creek, which runs through gorge and canyon, across the meadow floor, beneath scenic rock outcroppings, and is surrounded at times by Redwoods and ferns.

These people were hunter-gatherers which made fine obsidian tools including, knives, arrows and spears. The Koliholmanok people were thought to number about 2,000 before the Europeans came to Alta California. When Spanish settlers arrived, it is believed that they called the native people guapo for their bravery, daring and good looks; the native people eventually became known as the Wappo. Mexican feudal barons and gold seekers upset the Wappo balance of life, and diseases such as smallpox devastated the Wappo population. By 1855, nearly 20 years after Missouri fur trapper George C. Yount planted the area’s first grapevines, only a fraction of the Wappo people remained. Wappo descendants in Napa and Sonoma counties continue to practice and honor their ancestral traditions. Dr. Edward T. Bale was given 18,000 acres of land in the 1840s through a Mexican land grant. To process grain into meal using water power, Dr. Bale built the nearby Bale Grist Mill, which is now a state historic park, 1.5 miles south of this park. The State Park was purchased in the 1870s by Dr. and Mrs. Charles M. Hitchcock of San Francisco. The Hitchcocks' second home, “Lonely,” was built on the property. Hitchcock, his wife Martha and his daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit, entertained San Francisco society at Lonely and helped popularize the sunny valley as a summer getaway from the city. Lillie had been saved from a fire by San Francisco firemen when she was a child. She became an unofficial mascot for San Francisco's fire brigades. After Lillie Hitchcock Coit's death in 1929, her bequest to the city paid for the building of nozzle- shaped Coit Tower, honoring San Francisco’s firefighters. Her summer home Lonely also burned to the ground in 1929. | True |  | True | Didn’t know about the state park in Northern California wine country? It’s time you learn a bit about Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, located in the rolling hills of St. Helena.

The hunters set up villages in areas near water and lived there until the 1700’s, when Spanish missionaries arrived and sent them to the nearby missions in San Jose, San Juan and Santa Cruz. Throughout the 1800’s, sheepherders roamed the land and built very simple homes. The homes provided them with protection and enable them to focus on herding sheep. In the mid-late 1800’s the gold rush came in full swing. The area was also mined for copper, as there was a big need for the metal in the Civil War. In fact, today you can still see some of the scars from the mining operations. Towards the end of the 1800’s, there were many people settled on the land, however many of them sold to men who were “multiple homestead owners.” They would combine the properties and form large cattle ranches. These ranches provided the basis for the park today. In the early 1900’s Henry Willard Coe, a wealthy rancher at the time, had his first daughter, Rhoda. Rhoda was passionate about the outdoors and in 1953 she gave her family’s ranch to the state of California. This was in her beloved father’s memory. Her lifelong passion for the outdoors led to providing the people of California with this amazing park. | True |  | True | This is one wild and open space -89,000 acres to be exact!

From the coastline, their lands extended inland about 30 miles. The Kashaya Pomo are expert artisans whose exquisite basketry graces museum collections all over the world. Historians estimate that at the time of the first Spanish contact, the Kashaya Pomo numbered about 1,500 people, occupying several large villages. Summers were spent fishing along the coast; in late fall the Kashaya moved inland to hunt and to reoccupy their winter villages. Over the years, the Kashaya Pomo people have been able to preserve much of their traditional culture. Today many Kashaya descendants occupy a rancheria near Stewarts Point as well as other areas near Fort Ross. On April 8, 1846, Ernest Rufus received a Mexican land grant for 17,500 acres along the coast. The area, called Rancho German, encompassed the land from about six miles north of Fort Ross to the Gualala River. The southern portion of the rancho included what is now Salt Point. Beginning in 1849, the land changed hands several times, becoming the site of several active sawmills from 1853 to 1859. Lumber was shipped on schooners to San Francisco. In 1870, the southern section of Rancho German was sold to Lewis Gerstle and Frederick Funcke to mill tanoak and other hardwoods.

From the coastline, their lands extended inland about 30 miles. The Kashaya Pomo are expert artisans whose exquisite basketry graces museum collections all over the world. Historians estimate that at the time of the first Spanish contact, the Kashaya Pomo numbered about 1,500 people, occupying several large villages. Summers were spent fishing along the coast; in late fall the Kashaya moved inland to hunt and to reoccupy their winter villages. Over the years, the Kashaya Pomo people have been able to preserve much of their traditional culture. Today many Kashaya descendants occupy a rancheria near Stewarts Point as well as other areas near Fort Ross. On April 8, 1846, Ernest Rufus received a Mexican land grant for 17,500 acres along the coast. The area, called Rancho German, encompassed the land from about six miles north of Fort Ross to the Gualala River. The southern portion of the rancho included what is now Salt Point. Beginning in 1849, the land changed hands several times, becoming the site of several active sawmills from 1853 to 1859. Lumber was shipped on schooners to San Francisco. In 1870, the southern section of Rancho German was sold to Lewis Gerstle and Frederick Funcke to mill tanoak and other hardwoods. They built a hotel in 1872 and surveyed the westernmost section of their ranch for the plat of a town they named Louisville After the sawmills ceased operations in 1876, the land was transitioned to grazing livestock as its primary use. | True |  | True | This 6,000 acre park lies on a beautiful stretch of the Sonoma County coast.

Before American explorer John C. Fremont found the place, it was known as Gavilan Peak. Mr. Fremont was also a captain in the U.S. Army Corps and in 1846 he and his crew were surveying the peak for its strategic military value. The local Mexican authority, General Jose Castro felt that this was a threat and ordered the men to leave the state. In response, Fremont built a makeshift stockade and raised an American flag on top of the peak. The U.S. Consul in Monterey wasn’t feeling Mr. Fremont’s movement either and thus he was duly ordered to leave the area. Eventually on a windy night, the flagpole which once stood prominently above the peak was blown down. Needless to say, Fremont and his men left the area and it is now a registered California Historical Landmark. | True |  | True | The 3,169-foot summit of Fremont Peak boasts expansive views of the surrounding Monterey Bay and Pacific Ocean.

Before American explorer John C. Fremont found the place, it was known as Gavilan Peak. Mr. Fremont was also a captain in the U.S. Army Corps and in 1846 he and his crew were surveying the peak for its strategic military value. The local Mexican authority, General Jose Castro felt that this was a threat and ordered the men to leave the state. In response, Fremont built a makeshift stockade and raised an American flag on top of the peak. The U.S. Consul in Monterey wasn’t feeling Mr. Fremont’s movement either and thus he was duly ordered to leave the area. Eventually on a windy night, the flagpole which once stood prominently above the peak was blown down. Needless to say, Fremont and his men left the area and it is now a registered California Historical Landmark. | True |  | True | The 3,169-foot summit of Fremont Peak boasts expansive views of the surrounding Monterey Bay and Pacific Ocean.

With the coming of Europeans, the essence of their existence—the vitality of the land, family life, the seasonal cycle, ritual and social interaction—was soon destroyed, along with large numbers of Miwok who had no immunity to the diseases introduced by the Europeans. Despite these drastic changes, descendents of the Central Sierra Miwok still live in the area, practicing ancient cultural traditions and passing them on to the next generation. Gold was found along the Tuolumne River in Stanislaus County by French sailors in 1849. Their camp quickly grew into a settlement known as French Bar or French Camp, and eventually became La Grange. The easily obtained placer gold played out by 1856. Gold mining returned to the Tuolumne River when the La Grange Dredging Company formed in 1905 to extract gold from an eight-mile section of the river, now part of the park. Several million dollars in gold were extracted before dredging operations ceased in 1952. Just as the Tuolumne River furnished water for mining, it also provided rich soil for agriculture, and by 1857 farms lined its banks. The farmers irrigated their crops with the spring floodwaters of the Tuolumne River, leaving them vulnerable to periods of drought. With the backing of farmers, in 1887 Assemblyman C. C. Wright proposed a new kind of local government agency - an irrigation district - to help deal with the problem of crop irrigation. The first district to be established under the Wright Act was the Turlock Irrigation District. To control water for irrigation, this district and the Modesto Irrigation District together constructed La Grange Dam in 1893. Despite this the water needs of the farmers were barely being met. To solve the problem, the Turlock Irrigation District built a 3,500-acre reservoir between La Grange and Waterford that became known as Turlock Lake. In 1950 the Turlock Irrigation District leased Turlock Lake, with its 26 miles of shoreline and 228 acres of foothill country, to the State of California to form Turlock Lake SRA. From several lookout points, visitors can view the surrounding savannas and some of the cattle ranches and orchards nearby. Lake Road, which separates the campground from the day-use area, offers an excellent perspective of the campground, the river and sloughs, and miles of dredger tailing piles,the by-product of a half century of gold mining. | True |  | True | Nestled in the rolling foothills of eastern Stanislaus County is this beautiful little gem, Turlock Lake. The park is bordered by the lake to the south and the Tuolumne River to the north. It is a host to various recreational activities such as swimming, boating and picnicking and is open year-round. It also offers visitors an opportunity to see the wonderful variety of native plant life that once flourished alongside the rivers of the San Joaquin Valley. | True | None | 5 | True | True | Tent Only, Tent, Vehicles & RVs | None |  |  | None | Turlock Lake State Recreation Area | True | None | Reserve Online | 28 |  | /california/turlock-lake/turlock-lake-campground |  | 1 | True |  |  | 2017-07-27T14:32:50.192-07:00 | True | 06099 | America/Los_Angeles | 23 | False | POINT (-120.581 37.6272) | None |  | 6 |  | True | False |  | 100.0 | 0.0 | 37.6272 |  | None | 1 | True | reserve_america | (209) 874-2056 | Nestled on the banks of the Tuolumne River, this campground has 67 sites available (some are tent only, so be sure to double check when you are making your reservation).

Hendy, who in the late 1800's first claimed this beautiful area as his own. Hendy found something within the peace and quiet of these moss encrusted groves that made him vow that neither saw nor ax would ever lay bare the inner bark of these giants. True to his word, as long as the land was his, the trees were never harmed. California was growing and the need for lumber was great. After Joshua P. Hendy died, the groves were sold. Down came the giant trees in the outlying areas and off to the mills they were hauled. Timber was cut and removed from all sides of the big groves, but never was an order given to attack the giants standing there.. Hendy Woods was sold to the people of California in August of 1958, to become one of our finest state parks. | True |  | True | About 20 miles from the coast, in the Anderson Valley lies this pristine 816 acre park.

Native Americans in enjoyed this property and made their arrowheads in the meadows. The close proximity to the creek and lake attracted game animals so it was also a favored hunting spot. The first white settlers built a cabin here about 1894 and our historic barn dates from 1895. The 2-story, 3-bedroom Log House dates from 1921 and is one of the few remaining hand-built log homes in the area. This property, like our 3 neighbors, has never been linked to the "grid." We make our own electricity using the creek to turn a turbine (hydro-electric); the water goes back into the creek after turning the turbine.

Their winter homes were covered in earth for insulation, and dug partially underground—two to three feet deep. Summer shelters consisted of branches laid over a framework of saplings and covered with brush. The Nisenan wove baskets for trapping fish and for carrying, winnowing and storing food. Many Nisenan baskets grace museum collections all over the world. The surviving descendants of area Nisenan are working toward Federal recognition for their tribe. In January of 1848, gold was discovered at nearby Coloma on traditional Nisenan lands. Within a few months, the foothill and mountain homelands of the native people were overrun by would-be millionaires. Europeans, Americans and even local residents dug, panned, deluged with high-pressure hoses, dredged and pounded the gold out of any place it might be found. Within months, mining activity expanded from the Coloma site on the South Fork to the Middle and North Forks, now a part of Auburn SRA. Although early mining created extensive environmental damage, the damage has since been diminished by natural processes. A rich array of historic and cultural features can be seen at the park. The Mountain Quarries Railroad Bridge, an early concrete arched bridge, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several historic bridges are still being used in remote areas. California’s highest bridge, the Foresthill Bridge, lies within the park. The hard rock tunnels on the Middle Fork of the American River were the earliest tunnels of this type constructed in California. Whitewater rafting through one of these tunnels at Tunnel Chute provides an unparalleled experience. | True |  | True | Gold panning, whitewater rafting, and off-road motorcycle riding are just a few of the unique recreational activities offered here. The Auburn State Recreation Area covers 40-miles of the North and Middle Forks of the American River. It was once a massive gold mining area, but is now enjoyed as a natural space.

Though physical remnants of these prehistoric Native Americans have not been well documented, a few items discovered in the area - projectile points, bedrock mortars and various shells - have been attributed to them. Esselen and Rumsien people still live in the Big Sur area, where they honor and practice the traditions of their ancestors. In 1834, Governor José Figueroa granted acreage to Juan Bautista Alvarado. Alvarado’s El Sur Rancho stretched from the River Chiquito del Sur (in today’s Carmel Valley) to below the Big Sur River. Mexico ceded California to the U.S. in 1848, at the end of the Mexican-American War. Beginning around 1862, the area was settled by people whose names—Pfeiffer, Partington, Post, Gamboa—are still found on local street signs and businesses. The park’s Manuel Peak was named for a member of the Chumash tribe, Immanuel Innocente, head cattle wrangler at El Sur Rancho. In 1868, Innocente moved his family north from San Buenaventura to the Big Sur area. That year they bought property along the river in what is now the park. Michael and Barbara Pfeiffer arrived here in 1869, settling at the mouth of Sycamore Canyon to ranch, farm and keep bees. Their son, John, lived along the Big Sur River, near the site of the Homestead cabin. In the early 20th century, a developer offered to buy some of John Pfeiffer’s land, planning to build a subdivision. Pfeiffer refused. Instead, he sold 680 acres—which became the nucleus of today’s park—to the State of California in 1933. The Great Depression was in full force in the early 1930s. One of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first official acts was to create the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC employed young men to develop recreational areas and conserve natural resources. From 1933 to 1942, nearly 2.5 million CCC corpsmen built roads, trails and structures in more than 800 state and federal parks and planted nearly three billion trees. The men here at CCC Camp S.P. 12 built campgrounds, buildings, fences, a footbridge and trails in this park. Their wood and stone “park rustic” style used redwood lumber and river rocks as building materials. Between construction jobs, they tackled fires and problematic poison oak. | True |  | True | With its towering redwoods, vast ocean views and rugged charm, it’s no wonder that this park has been nicknamed “little Yosemite.” Nestled in the Santa Lucia mountains, Pfieffer Big Sur also features a plethora of animal life, ranging from black-tail deer to water ouzels.

They used the forested terrain as well as the coast for hunting and harvesting what they needed for sustenance, utility and ornament. Surviving Esselen descendants in Monterey County continue to honor and practice many of their ancestral traditions. The area of today’s park was homesteaded by a number of pioneers in the 1870s, including the McWay (for the whom the gorgeous waterfall is named) and Partington families. Homesteaders were largely self-sufficient - making a living as loggers, tanoak harvesters or ranchers by using only the resources available on the Big Sur coast. Michael Pfeiffer moved to Sycamore Canyon in 1869 when his daughter Julia was an infant. She spent her life in Big Sur, inspired by its terrain, the sea and the wildlife. Former U.S. congressman Lathrop Brown and his wife, Helen Hooper Brown, purchased property at Saddle Rock as a vacation retreat. Julia Pfeiffer and her husband John Burns leased pasture land from the Browns at Saddle Rock, near McWay Falls. The Burnses lived south of the park at Slate’s Hot Springs (now the Esalen Institute), providing tourists with hot meals and a bed. The Browns enjoyed Julia’s plain-spoken manner and big heart, and they donated Saddle Rock Ranch as a state park dedicated to Julia Pfeiffer Burns in 1962. The splendor and seclusion of the Big Sur coast continues to draw vacationers to this park. | True |  | True | Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is the envy of state parks nation-wide. You can’t beat waterfalls dropping over 80 foot cliffs into the Pacific Ocean, or endless coastal trails that weave above the bluffs. Nothing says Big Sur camping like waking up to dramatic view of the Pacific, but if you ever get sick of the magical coastal scenery, Julia Pfeiffer Burns extends from the coastline all the way up to the nearby ridges, some of them 3,000 feet high. Take a break from the coast to enjoy redwood, madrone and chaparral trees, and enjoy backcountry hiking when you explore this park’s extensive trail system. Looking to stretch your sea legs? A 1,680-acre marine reserve is one of the little-known gems in the area, making Julia Pfeiffer Burns camping the best around. Julia Pfeiffer Burns Campground is the place to stay in Big Sur (or, the nation!), and is a popular destination year-round, so you’ll need to book early... Like, the first person to book 7-months in advance at 7am early. With only two sites to book at Julia Pfeiffer Burns Campground, there’s plenty of seclusion here, with excellent views of the Big Sur coastline visible from most areas. It’s the perfect place to relax after a long day of exploring the tall ridges and ancient trees. If you score a spot here, get ready to be lulled to sleep to the sounds of the Pacific. | True | None | 345 | True | True | Tent Only | None |  | 28 | None | Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park | True | None | Reserve Online | 32 |  | /california/julia-pfeiffer-burns/julia-pfeiffer-burns-campground |  | 1 | True |  |  | 2017-02-23T10:42:30.870-08:00 | True | 06053 | America/Los_Angeles | 10 | False | POINT (-121.672 36.1711) | None | 0.96 | 6 |  | True | False |  | 96.4285714286 | 0.0 | 36.1711 |  | None | 28 | True | reserve_america | (831) 667-2315 | This park may only have two camping spots, but they are known to be some of the best camping in California!

Awaken the adventurer within, and go for a ride down the gently winding river, go swimming in the cool, refreshing water at one of the several springs located close to the site, or just relax on the deck and observe the beauty of nature unfolding all around you.Our campsite features a raised deck (7ftx7ft) for keeping tents and sleeping bags off of the ground. The deck is ideal for 5 to 6 campers, and the site has parking adjacent. We also offer battery operated blow-up air mattresses free of charge, as well as a gas grill on site, along with all the utensils needed for cooking and eating comfortably.We offer 3 different vessels for exploring the length of the nearby river. The first is a 16" canoe, which can easily seat 3 people. Next, we have a 16" kayak with 2 seats. Finally, we offer a 17" ocean kayak, which can seat a single person. Along with the boats, we also have a great assortment of paddles, life preservers, docking lines, and an anchor, all freely available. Right near the kayaks is a gently sloped bank, leading to a shallow part of the river, perfect for getting the vessels in and out of the water.Begin your Santa Fe River adventure in Poe Spring, located next to the campsite. In this area, you will see many naturally occurring outlets for the underground water coming up to the surface. Continue down the river until you reach Lilly Spring, about 1 mile away from the campsite. Explore the area, and take in the unparalleled scenery and beauty of nature. If you'd like, you can continue down the river for another mile, and arrive at Rum Island; a small, natural island in the middle of the river. If you travel for another mile and a half down the river, you will come to July Spring and Ginny Spring, both very popular attractions in the area. When you're ready to head back to the campsite, you can paddle back easily against the gentle current.For those less experienced in traveling on the water, or those who just want a guided experience, we offer lessons and tours along the river for additional cost. Don't miss a thing along this gorgeous stretch of nature, and make your retreat one to remember for a long time to come! Tours are typically available on the weekends, and generally will last from 2 to 3 hours.AmenitiesRaised DeckGas GrillCooking UtensilsAir Mattress + Battery Operated BlowupThree River VesselsWater GearPricingCampsite Rental: $20 / NightBoat Rental: Quoted upon RequestLessons / Guided Tours: $150 for 3 hours | 2016-06-29T08:29:00.046-07:00 | True | None |

These skilled fishermen, trappers and hunters built their seasonal villages alongside the flourishing rivers of the Sierra Nevada foothills. The acorns and other seeds the Miwok harvested in the fall were a vital part of their diet. Their way of life was rich in ceremony and social activity, including the important harvesting and grinding of the fall acorn crop. Throughout this area, large granite outcroppings and boulders with groups of mortar holes bear witness to the Miwok method of grinding seeds and acorns. Today, approximately 3,500 Miwok descendants live in the area. In the spring of 1852, Augustus T. Dowd was tracking a wounded grizzly bear through unfamiliar territory when he came upon a forest of enormous trees. The giant sequoia that first caught his attention was the largest in what is now the Calaveras North Grove. At first, Dowd’s description of what he had seen was considered a “tall tale” until he led a group of men to the grove. Word of the giant sequoia grove’s existence spread rapidly. Newspapers picked up the story, bringing curious visitors and entrepreneurs eager to make their fortunes from naive spectators. The Discovery Tree that had earlier stopped Dowd in his tracks was the first casualty in the rush to exploit the giant sequoias. It took five men 22 days to cut it down. Sections of bark and a portion of its trunk were shipped to San Francisco to be placed on display. Later it was sent around Cape Horn to New York City, where it was considered a “humbug” by many who saw it. The financially unsuccessful showing closed, and while the tree’s artifacts were awaiting shipment to Paris, a fire destroyed the entire exhibit. The Discovery Tree’s stump remains in the North Grove. Further depredations continued in the North Grove. A magnificent tree named the “Mother of the Forest” was stripped of nearly 60 tons of its bark to a height of 116 feet. The bark was sent to the East Coast and abroad for exhibition. In 1861 the Mammoth Grove Hotel was built in the North Grove. The resort hotel operated until 1943, when it was destroyed by a fire. Calaveras became a State Park in 1931 to preserve the North Grove of giant sequoias. This grove includes the "Discovery Tree", also known as the "Big Stump", the first Sierra redwood noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852. This area has been a major tourist attraction ever since, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California. | True |  | True | It’s not every day that you can say you camped and explored among trees that are upwards of 2,000 years old, and descended from trees that were standing when dinosaurs roamed Earth. Located at the mid-elevation level of the western Sierra Nevada, Calaveras Big Trees State Park is comprised of over 6,400 acres and there is much exploring to be done. There is a vast array of recreational activities and miles of established trails to scout out. From hiking, picnicking, fishing, and enjoying the wildlife, this state park is not to be missed. Calaveras Big Trees State Park camping includes tent and RV camping, as well a few reservable cabins.

The Discovery Tree that had earlier stopped Dowd in his tracks was the first casualty in the rush to exploit the giant sequoias. It took five men 22 days to cut it down. Sections of bark and a portion of its trunk were shipped to San Francisco to be placed on display. Later it was sent around Cape Horn to New York City, where it was considered a “humbug” by many who saw it. The financially unsuccessful showing closed, and while the tree’s artifacts were awaiting shipment to Paris, a fire destroyed the entire exhibit. The Discovery Tree’s stump remains in the North Grove. Further depredations continued in the North Grove. A magnificent tree named the “Mother of the Forest” was stripped of nearly 60 tons of its bark to a height of 116 feet. The bark was sent to the East Coast and abroad for exhibition. In 1861 the Mammoth Grove Hotel was built in the North Grove. The resort hotel operated until 1943, when it was destroyed by a fire. Calaveras became a State Park in 1931 to preserve the North Grove of giant sequoias. This grove includes the "Discovery Tree", also known as the "Big Stump", the first Sierra redwood noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852. This area has been a major tourist attraction ever since, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California. | True |  | True | It’s not every day that you can say you camped and explored among trees that are upwards of 2,000 years old, and descended from trees that were standing when dinosaurs roamed Earth. Located at the mid-elevation level of the western Sierra Nevada, Calaveras Big Trees State Park is comprised of over 6,400 acres and there is much exploring to be done. There is a vast array of recreational activities and miles of established trails to scout out. From hiking, picnicking, fishing, and enjoying the wildlife, this state park is not to be missed. Calaveras Big Trees State Park camping includes tent and RV camping, as well a few reservable cabins. Each site has fire rings and picnic tables, piped water, flush toilets, and pay showers nearby.  | True | None | 43 | True | True | Tent Only, Tent, Vehicles & RVs | None |  | 10 | None | Calaveras Big Trees State Park | True | None | Reserve Online | 34 |  | /california/calaveras-big-trees/north-grove-campground |  | 1 | True |  |  | 2017-04-13T16:30:54.009-07:00 | True | 06009 | America/Los_Angeles | 5 | False | POINT (-120.287 38.2719) | None | 1.0 | 6 |  | True | False |  | 100.0 | 0.0 | 38.2719 |  | None | 10 | True | reserve_america | (209) 795-2334 | One of two walk-in campgrounds in the Calaveras Big Trees state park is the North Grove campground and is a great option for Calaveras Big Trees camping. It is located about two miles in, surrounded by the towering redwoods that give the park its name. Campsites are located along a loop with a few smaller loops that circle Big Tree Creek. While it is technically walk-in, the sites are located fairly close to the parking area, meaning you won’t have to carry your gear too far. While there are over 70 sites, in general the spaces are nicely distanced from one another.

John Van Damme and his wife were a Flemish couple. The patriarch of the family was born in Ostend, Belgium on May 22, 1832. "Following the sea" for some years, Van Damme, upon his arrival in Mendocino County, later worked in the lumber mill at Little River. In this settlement all of his children were born, including Charles, whose love for the area prompted his acquiring, after some years as a successful operator of the Richmond-San Rafael ferry line, a plot of ground along the redwood coast. Upon his demise this area became a part of the State Park System in 1934. In those early days lumbering was a major economic factor in the development of the northern coastline. Little River was built as a mill town in 1864 by Ruel Stickney, Silas Coombs and Tapping Reeves after the property, formally called Kents Cove, was purchased from W. H. Kent in 1862. Before long it had attained fame, not only as a lumber port, but as a shipyard as well. Alas, a stand of timber, if logged, does not last forever and by the end of the century, even though logging was periodically moved back into the headwaters of Little River, the mill was forced to close in 1893. What was left of Little River soon deteriorated; the shipyard, the wharf, the town, several chutes for loading lumber and the lumber mill itself. Activity at the port, which once hummed with activity, declined. Little River's school, once attended by nearly 100 students, closed; its weekly steamship service ended, and a shipyard where, in 1874, Captain Thomas Peterson turned out full-size lumber schooners for the coast wide trade, phased out. Only the schooner Little River returned, to be wrecked on the very beach from which it originally departed. Plagued by a lack of sufficient timber reserves, fires, substantial loss of business and trade, deterioration of the port's chutes and wharf, the end of coast wide shipping and the attendant decline in population, Little River reverted to a natural state. Its acquisition by the State Park System in 1934, and the subsequent addition of peripheral lands has preserved some of California's most interesting natural resources. | True |  | True | Hugging the coast of State Route 1 is Van Damme State Park.

Native groups traveled from the coast to the interior valleys, following the marine and terrestrial resources that sustained them. They gathered fish, shellfish and various grasses and seeds, and hunted small and large game and birds. They traded with other groups for items they could not produce themselves. The incursion of the Spanish, Mexicans and Americans brought changes that drastically affected the lives of the people. Taken into the mission system, the people struggled with diseases to which they had no immunity. Pestilence, violence and broken promises all took their toll; seemingly well-intentioned treaties with the Indians were not sent to federal offices for ratification. Within a few generations, the native people’s traditional lands had been taken over by the settlers. At the end of the mission era, some of the native people were employed in agriculture, fishing and other industries. Today, descendants of the Salinan, Esselen and Ohlone people are working to revive their cultural traditions and to pass them on to the next generations. Beginning in 1887, the Rockland Lime and Lumber Company extracted, processed and exported thousands of barrels of lime from Limekiln Canyon. Four stone and iron furnaces were built at the base of a large talus slope eroding from a limestone deposit. Limestone rocks were loaded into the kilns, where very hot wood fires burned for long periods to purify the lime. The lime was packed into barrels, hauled by wagon to Rockland Landing on the coast, and loaded onto ships that carried it to northern ports for use in concrete. After only three years, the limestone deposit was all but depleted, as was the redwood forest that had been nearly clear-cut to use for lumber and fuel. Today the four kilns, some stone walls and bridge abutments are the only remains of the thriving lime industry that existed here. | True |  | True | Along the spectacular Big Sur coast lies Limekiln State Park. As you can imagine, here you can get epic views of the Big Sur Coast as well as the grandeur of the redwoods. Although the park is small, this rugged coastal park offers up a beach, a redwood forest and 100-foot waterfall and is rich in historical significance.

There are 29 campsites (4 are walk-in), and RVs and trailers aren’t allowed on the redwoods side (only at campsites 5 through 16). The two loops have very different atmospheres, and, in general, you will find families on the Redwood side and surfers and ocean-lovers on the other. Some of the sites on the ocean view are in the shadow of the Highway 1 overpass, so keep that in mind as you are selecting your site. Word on the street is that the best sites are 1, 2, and 3, but they are first-come, first serve and you can’t reserve specific sites online, so getting there early is always a good idea. | 2013-12-20T18:48:30.960-08:00 |  | None | None

The first white settlers built a cabin here about 1894 and our historic barn dates from 1895. The 2-story, 3-bedroom Log House dates from 1921 and is one of the few remaining hand-built log homes in the area. This property, like our 3 neighbors, has never been linked to the "grid." We make our own electricity using the creek to turn a turbine (hydro-electric); the water goes back into the creek after turning the turbine.

It is believed that U.S. government surveyors later gave the name "Russian Gulch" to the area 50 miles north of Fort Ross to honor these early pioneers. In 1852 Harry Meiggs, a San Francisco engineer and promoter, erected a sawmill at Big River. This was the start of redwood lumber industry on the Mendocino Coast. Soon other mills were popping up in all the little inlets, or "dog holes" as they were called. Since the sea was the only means of travel, these dog holes such as Russian Gulch were regular stops for the little schooners traveling from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay. They would bring freight and passengers on the way north and pick up lumber and passengers on the way back. This was a very dangerous operation in bad weather, and many of the little ships were lost. Some of the old iron rings used to hold the high lines that loaded lumber on the ships can be seen anchored in the rocks along the headlands. Redwood was considered excellent material for railroad ties, and Russian Gulch produced many of the ties used on the transcontinental railroad. Shingles were also produced here . One of the first redwood shingle mills in this part of the country was built on the site where the recreation hall stands today. Russian Gulch State Park was acquired in 1933 through gifts of land and money by A. Johnston and the County of Mendocino to match State Park funds. | True |  | True | Really, what doesn’t Russian Gulch State Park have? The 7,630 feet of heavily forested rocky shores that make up the area are ruggedly gorgeous. They also feature the Devil’s Punch Bowl (a large, collapsed sea cave with churning water), tide pools, and a beach where you can swim, skin dive and go rock fishing. Did we mention there is also a waterfall? Hikers rejoice, there are miles of quality trails and even a few paved bicycle trails. Also, look out for the “blow hole,” which cannot be missed when the surging high tide comes in. | True | None | 54 | True | True | Tent Only, Tent, Vehicles & RVs | None |  | 14 | None | Russian Gulch State Park | True | None | Reserve Online | 37 |  | /california/russian-gulch/russian-gulch-campground |  | 1 | True |  |  | 2017-02-23T10:36:00.529-08:00 | True | 06045 | America/Los_Angeles | 17 | False | POINT (-123.780008148193 39.3311747266888) | None | 1.0 | 6 |  | True | False |  | 100.0 | 0.0 | 39.3311747267 |  | None | 14 | True | reserve_america | (707) 937-5804 | Right up the road from Van Damme State Park, this campground is a nice spot to stay if you plan to explore the Mendocino Coast.

In season, we have a splash pool in where guests like to relax in the afternoon. There is a doggie pool for the doggies, and of course they also enjoy our creek and lake. Dogs are welcome off leash! Some of our trails lead into the National Forest. From the pavement, we are at the end of a 1 1/2 mile decent gravel road, no 4-wheel drive needed. We have mostly gently rolling terrain with 2 hills, elevation about 2500’ Off the property but nearby are hot springs, swimming holes, 2 larger lakes for boating and fishing, and impressive waterfalls. We are 60 miles NE of Redding, and 1 1/2 hours by car both from Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen National Park. If our rates seem high, it is because we only host one group at a time, for your peace and privacy. Besides the natural beauty, everyone notices the QUIET. Stars visible, too! Native Americans in enjoyed this property and made their arrowheads in the meadows. The close proximity to the creek and lake attracted game animals so it was also a favored hunting spot. The first white settlers built a cabin here about 1894 and our historic barn dates from 1895. The 2-story, 3-bedroom Log House dates from 1921 and is one of the few remaining hand-built log homes in the area. This property, like our 3 neighbors, has never been linked to the "grid." We make our own electricity using the creek to turn a turbine (hydro-electric); the water goes back into the creek after turning the turbine. Once owned by famous Driscoll Strawberry Associates, this property was where they developed new varieties since we are remote and far from potential cross-pollination.  | True | None | 20 | True | True | Tent, Vehicles & RVs | 5 |  |  | None | Forest Springs | True | 90.0 | Reserve Online | 10825 | 2 | /california/forest-springs/forest-springs-rv | 11AM | 1 | True | 90.00 | Strict | 2017-02-24T08:56:33.095-08:00 | True | 06089 | America/Los_Angeles | 3920 | False | POINT (-121.9116 41.0592) | 5 |  | 2 | 3PM | True | True | 2 | 0.0 | 10.0 | 41.0592 |  |  | 0 | True | hipbook | (530) 337-6704 | Please see Forest Springs CAMPING for info on RV sites.We offer tent camping, RV camping, a complete guesthouse, and any combination.

The Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest includes the Wasatch Mountain Range, the High Uintas Wilderness, and countless other gems that keep people coming back again and again (it’s the most frequently visited forest area in the country). Nearby major metro areas include Logan, Ogden, Salt Lake City, and the infamous skiing town of Park City. In the winter, come for Utah’s first-rate powder days, and then head back during the summer for some hiking, fishing, canyon exploring, and ridiculously good looking scenery. Road trippers should check out the Mt. Nebo National Scenic Byway, a road that stretches 37 miles through seemingly endless overlooks, mountains, and valleys.

This is mainly due to the fact that it is mainly “boat in,” however Three additional sites have been developed for equestrian, hikers, and bicyclists accessing the area via the Potter’s Ravine Trail. However, if you’re hiking in, just be prepared for the journey (it’s over 11 miles). If you’d like to go for the more classic experience, you’ll have to get yourself a boat. No worries my friend, you can rent a boat from our friends Forever Resorts. Just remember that in drought years, some areas are much less accessible (so make sure to check conditions). This campground is also great for insanely huge groups (it can accommodate up to 75 people). Each site has your standard picnic table, fire ring, and toilet (you’ll have to bring your own water). | 2013-12-20T18:48:30.956-08:00 |  | None | None
