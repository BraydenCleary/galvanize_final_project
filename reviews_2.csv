I honestly don't know if I'll ever get a weekend spot, but I'm determined to keep my eye on sites as they open, up to 6 months in advance. Since I was the only person camping on Wednesday, I explored every corner and nook of Angel Island. There literally is not a spot on the island that doesn't have an awesome view. Ridge sites 4,5 are killer, ridge site 6 is tucked away just a bit, but is only steps from that sweet view of the Bay Area. I'd love to come back and stay at any of the East Bay spots (scoped out a great spot for a hammock at EB site 3) and experience the sunrise from the other side of the island. Upon hiking to the top of Mt. Livermore, I was surprised to find multiple picnicking platforms. These aren't marked on the trail map. If you hike to the top, bring a game or some grub and plan on chilling up there, the views are AMAZE. I can't believe it took me so long to camp here! Though, due to booked weekends 6 months out, it makes sense. If you live in the area, take a lil' baycation, and visit during the week. Plus, when you have the island all to yourself you can do whatever the heck you want. ;) Sooo worth it!  | /u/julie | 2015-02-12T20:03:10.843-08:00 | Julie | Angel Island Campground | After living in SF for over 4 years, I finally made it to Angel Island... on a Wednesday!

Be advised! | https://graph.facebook.com/1183292538396074/picture?width=150&height=150 | So far I have tent camped at site 5 in sunny January and just now at site 6 in rainy October. Both times were stunning. The tent sites are remote and separate, hardly visible. Longer walk back to the (flush) toilet but outhouse is in close proximity. Fire pits and provided food lockers must be used, our ice chest rolling around at 3:30 am (because it wouldn't fit) reminded us of that. Thankfully it was locked and the animal couldn't get inside.

Overall, love the campground and we will be back again! | Back Ranch Meadows Campground, China Camp State Park | 4 | mailto:support@hipcamp.com?body=%0A%0ATip id%3A 8abf8a54-b683-442e-9270-4add938b0186&subject=Inappropriate tip | 8abf8a54-b683-442e-9270-4add938b0186 | d9508807-2d3b-42de-a7a2-a144e77154ac | February 16th, 2015 | tip | Clinton Loo | 8abf8a54-b683-442e-9270-4add938b0186

We noticed some campsites were still open so we had asked if we could move our camping gear to a site that was more shaded, the ranger was more than happy to let us switch sites. The campsite has lots of lovely critters, wild turkeys, squirrels, little salamanders. At night the raccoons will come out. There are plenty of wasp traps so there are not a lot of bees around the campsites, however, there are lots of fruit flies and very few mosquitoes. I had taken my camera with me and added more photos of the campsites. Will definitely be going again. | /u/cydneyhall | 2016-06-28T12:48:28.008-07:00 | Cydney | Back Ranch Meadows Campground | Made a reservation for 005 - it was incredibly hot as there are not many trees, we did go early in the day, around 3pm the heat was unbearable.

Camp centre is well equipped: firewood for sale, a well stocked gift shop and small grocery/cafe with espresso, snacks and a small museum attached. Showers are a quarter for two minutes, but beware - they aren't very warm! This is a great place to stay a few nights, hike and check out the redwoods and the abundant wildlife.

Overall, more of a quick-and-dirty party site than a secluded getaway. | Huckleberry Campground, Big Basin Redwoods State Park | 3 | mailto:support@hipcamp.com?body=%0A%0ATip id%3A b30a10b4-bdc8-49ab-a0fd-46957b71d612&subject=Inappropriate tip | b30a10b4-bdc8-49ab-a0fd-46957b71d612 | 2b6f3f5a-77b6-4c00-9f7a-926dcb0587ea | February 15th, 2016 | tip | Madison Kotack | b30a10b4-bdc8-49ab-a0fd-46957b71d612

However, beware if you're camping here during a particularly rainy period - we (along with most others in the campground) packed up a day early.

Just reserve a site in advance. | Bodega Dunes Campground, Sonoma Coast State Beach | 1 | mailto:support@hipcamp.com?body=%0A%0ATip id%3A b847c5a0-1849-4c43-a9ba-0338a6807c15&subject=Inappropriate tip | b847c5a0-1849-4c43-a9ba-0338a6807c15 | b6c206ae-5aef-41d5-ade8-f75a592f3ef6 | September 5th, 2015 | tip | Julian Jensen | b847c5a0-1849-4c43-a9ba-0338a6807c15

It's on native land, a valley that's having a revival turning agricultural farms into vineyards. There are things offered nearby, from horseback riding and hiking to wine tasting, but the valley itself is kind of hidden. One of those corners of the world that remind you that California is one incredibly varied and wide open state. The property itself is owned and managed by Thomas, a Chumash native. He greeted and spoke to us for the first hour or so, telling about the ancient spirituality of the land (vortex mountains), the issues it has now (no water regulation) and other native facts. The tipi was extremely well built, and even had a little fire pit for morning coffee. It had two beds and side tables too. Would be a great place to camp in the winter months. Though because of the high altitude - was 100 degrees during the day but got quite freezing in the early morning. I was glad he left us blankets and bedding (though they were dusty and the dogs had sat on them while we were speaking). There was a separate BBQ and then a fire pit with surrounding stumps. We were allowed a fire, had our meal, and stargazed. Because of the high altitude, THE STARS were magnificent. We could see the Milky Way, though it only touched one horizon. The other horizon did have slight light pollution coming over the mountains, but barely. There was also a few night flood lights from neighboring farms, as well as a generator that created the only noise during the night. Things Thomas hopes to bring to the land are: -A few claw foot bathtubs with natural hot mineral water. The springs are ready, but a walkway needs to be built. -Figure out some sort of bedding situation, whether to offer it or not (it can get quite dusty). -A shaded area for coffee and tea in the morning. The structure is built but there's nothing usable yet. - A shower. - More trees and landscaping. Some trees are planted and growing but are baby and brand new! - He offers visits to his other ranch to see the horses. What is current (August 2016): - An outhouse with flushing toilet (think 80's RV style) and toilet paper. -Tipis, most barren inside, some with beds. -A very large fire pit with some scrap wood (still recommend bringing some yourself). Note that the fire pit is shared amongst all tipis. -Outdoor chairs and a grill that could probably be started up. In conclusion, I think this land has great potential, but Thomas recognizes that he needs help. Anyone interested in work-trade please inquire. Once the mineral baths get going, if they will be well built and well-kept, I'd definitely visit again for a little private getaway. Hopefully the neighbors can tone down their floodlights and generators. It wasn't too obtrusive though, and the drive through the mountains to Ojai was magnificent, as well as the oil fields over the cliff by Taft. There's a lot more to learn about this land than I was able to explore. In August it was fairly brown, but it the spring will be green. The tipis were so cool, and didn't feel ingenuine at all as they were built by a native. Would be a good spot to do some motorbiking around, or to explore a bunch of different things while having a comfortable base. Solar showers would be good, Thomas plans to install something similar in the future. He was very welcoming and accommodating, and would work with you on what you need. Close to LA, but in a culture so far away. I give my best wishes for the progress on this HipCamp!  | /u/rheacutillo | 2016-08-22T15:38:32.419-07:00 | Rhea | Dakota Tipi Village - 12 ft. | Dakota Tipi Village Camp is situated between the picturesque mountains leading out of Ojai, and the intriguing expanse of flat oil fields heading towards Bakersfield.

The tipi was extremely well built, and even had a little fire pit for morning coffee. It had two beds and side tables too. Would be a great place to camp in the winter months. Though because of the high altitude - was 100 degrees during the day but got quite freezing in the early morning. I was glad he left us blankets and bedding (though they were dusty and the dogs had sat on them while we were speaking). There was a separate BBQ and then a fire pit with surrounding stumps. We were allowed a fire, had our meal, and stargazed. Because of the high altitude, THE STARS were magnificent. We could see the Milky Way, though it only touched one horizon. The other horizon did have slight light pollution coming over the mountains, but barely. There was also a few night flood lights from neighboring farms, as well as a generator that created the only noise during the night. Things Thomas hopes to bring to the land are: -A few claw foot bathtubs with natural hot mineral water. The springs are ready, but a walkway needs to be built. -Figure out some sort of bedding situation, whether to offer it or not (it can get quite dusty). -A shaded area for coffee and tea in the morning. The structure is built but there's nothing usable yet. - A shower. - More trees and landscaping. Some trees are planted and growing but are baby and brand new! - He offers visits to his other ranch to see the horses. What is current (August 2016): - An outhouse with flushing toilet (think 80's RV style) and toilet paper. -Tipis, most barren inside, some with beds. -A very large fire pit with some scrap wood (still recommend bringing some yourself). Note that the fire pit is shared amongst all tipis. -Outdoor chairs and a grill that could probably be started up. In conclusion, I think this land has great potential, but Thomas recognizes that he needs help. Anyone interested in work-trade please inquire. Once the mineral baths get going, if they will be well built and well-kept, I'd definitely visit again for a little private getaway. Hopefully the neighbors can tone down their floodlights and generators. It wasn't too obtrusive though, and the drive through the mountains to Ojai was magnificent, as well as the oil fields over the cliff by Taft. There's a lot more to learn about this land than I was able to explore. In August it was fairly brown, but it the spring will be green. The tipis were so cool, and didn't feel ingenuine at all as they were built by a native. Would be a good spot to do some motorbiking around, or to explore a bunch of different things while having a comfortable base. Solar showers would be good, Thomas plans to install something similar in the future. He was very welcoming and accommodating, and would work with you on what you need. Close to LA, but in a culture so far away.

It's on native land, a valley that's having a revival turning agricultural farms into vineyards. There are things offered nearby, from horseback riding and hiking to wine tasting, but the valley itself is kind of hidden.

The large property is intended to be explored as there are a series of trails that cover the majority of the property. Colette provided us with a map that is very detailed and pairs well with the marked trails. There are open meadows, thick forest, mountain ponds, and natural springs all at Forest Springs. The natural spring not only provides life to wild residents (flora and fauna alike) its power is also converted to provide electricity for this off-the-grid establishment. The property is well cared for and it is apparent that Colette has a deep love and respect for the land. The camping area is near large trees, close to the bathroom/showerhouse, and provides a sweeping view of the front meadow. Depending on the size of the group and the other guests for the weekend, camping location may vary, but either area is very nice. The area to pitch a tent is on grass, which is always a preferred surface for me. I also liked the small, dug-in fire-pits that were close to the sites. The pits also came with a metal grill that can be placed over the lava rock firepit. The highlight of the day was getting to soak in the large soaking tub that is filled with natural spring water. A small walk removed from any building or campsite, the tub gives a great view of the back meadow and forest beyond. I don't have any complaints about the property, as the off-the-beaten-path feel, the sites, and the environment are all top-notch. I definitely see myself coming back for a few nights so I can properly explore the property and the local area. | /u/niccastellanos | 2016-08-24T14:26:27.460-07:00 | Nic | Camping, Forest Springs | Forest Springs tent camping is a great place to get some of the creature comforts of home while still getting the full outdoors experience.

While North Grove seemed a bustle of both campers and extra day visitors, Oak Hollow (over 3 miles further into the park) has more tranquility.

Site 29 is by far the best spot in the whole place. Because I camped here as a kid, it will always be magical to me! | Limekiln Campground, Limekiln State Park | 0 | mailto:support@hipcamp.com?body=%0A%0ATip id%3A 809f2000-577e-45ac-8637-9409d8d6d64e&subject=Inappropriate tip | 809f2000-577e-45ac-8637-9409d8d6d64e | bf74da9b-8f5e-48df-a60a-6f659e4c257b | April 23rd, 2017 | tip | Amber Howe | 809f2000-577e-45ac-8637-9409d8d6d64e

I managed to grab a reservation for the very end of January - right when a lot of the mudslides were occurring. Because of the mudslides, we took the inland route (since HWY 1 was closed) and it only added more adventure to our trip. The back route (Nacimiento-Furgusson Rd) spits you out straight onto HWY 1 after driving through Fort Hunter-Liggett. Because of the closed HWY and mudslides, it seemed to us like a lot of people bailed on their reservations so we had the campground almost to ourselves. The stream that ends at the beach was roaring and the waterfall was full and breath taking! Awesome camphosts and just a beautiful, peaceful location.

First, I should talk about the property in general. The physical structures of the property sit in the middle and on either side are beautiful meadows that transition to dense forest. There is a natural spring system and corresponding creek that is the life blood of the forest and makes this particular area teeming with critters. There is an abundance of natural fruit, varied vegetation, thick trees, and unspoiled land. The power of the natural spring is harnessed and converted to energy, which is how the power on the property is produce. Forest Springs is completely off-the-grid, but there doesn't seem to be anything sacrificed in the process. An abundance of water, ample electricity, and a full bathroom/shower make it easy to get comfortable here. Colette has gone to great lengths to develop a trail and map system that covers the whole of this large property. There are hidden lakes/ponds, old bridges crossing the stream, and animals galore in the surrounding forest and groves. The RV itself is equipped with more than what was expected. It has electricity, a dual electric stove-top, microwave, coffeemaker, working toilet and shower (water is cold). There is also a small fan, which is crucial during the hot summer days. The bed is comfortable and comes with a top sheet, but it is never a bad idea to bring your own sheet to throw on top. There is a permanent covering built around the RV that gives an added level of protection and shade. The opening is pointed towards the forest and adjacent berry thicket, which scores major points in the camp vibe category. This property alone has a ton to offer and the surrounding area also has swimming and hot springs options, which makes this a perfect place to spend a couple days. The site is private and comfortable and is very close to a main trail, which makes this a place I would definitely recommend.
